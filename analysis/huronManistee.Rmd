## Huron-Manistee National Forest
The Huron-Manistee National Forest is ~1 million acres and is in the lower peninsula of Michigan.  The forest is home to wild and scenic rivers such as the Pine, Manistee and Pere Marquette, and rare species such as Kirtland's warbler, Karner Blue Butterfly and Pitcher's thistle.

## 5 ecosystems covered ~90% of the landscape historically

LANDFIRE data is designed for use over large areas.  It's a good idea to review initial outputs before proceeding.  For example here we want to see which Biophysical Settings (BpSs, historical ecosystems mapped by LANDFIRE) were most prevalent before we go to calculate historical fire regimes.

We found:

* LANDFIRE mapped 20 BpSs
* 5 BpSs covered ~90% of the landscape historically
* This pattern of a relativity low number of BpSs dominating a landscape is typical in our experience

## How much area burned annually prior to European settlement?

 <font size="6"> Approximately 80,000 acres </font>
 
 We found that the there was substantial amounts of fire in some key BpSs:
 
 * The Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens had the most fire historically, with ~ 58k acres of fire each year historically, or about 22% of this ecosystem.
 * Almost all fires in the Huron-Manistee NF were modeled as "surface" fires, with less than 25% top-kill.

## Interpretation, implications and future directions

<br>

### Interpretation
Historically fire was not evenly distributed across the landscape, rather it was highly related to the Biophysical Settings, with some being highly fire adapted (e.g., Laurentian Pine-Oak Barrens) and some not (e.g., Laurentian-Acadian Northern Hardwoods Forest-Hemlock).  

Currently there is 20x less fire per year than there was historically.  Some patterns jump out:

* While highly variable the amount of wildfire is trending upward
* Prescribed fire is fairly steady
* Wildland fire use appears to be declining if not missing altogether

### Implications
We did not explore ecosystem specific implications here (see future directions below).  What we can see is that Vegetation Departure (index that "indicates how different current vegetation on a landscape is from estimated historical conditions", from https://landfire.gov/vdep.php) is relativity high across the entire area, including within the Huron-Manistee National Forest.  

**Map of LANDFIRE's [Vegetation Departure](https://landfire.gov/vdep.php) dataset for the Huron-Manistee National Forest.  Green indicates a structural condition closer to modeled historical conditions.**  

```{r hmnfVdep map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/hmnfVdep.jpg", error = FALSE)
```


### Future directions
Our analysis points to substantial differences in fire regimes for the Huron-Manistee National Forest, and maps of Vegetation Departure indicate high levels of differences between historical and current vegetation structure.  That said questions remain, many of which can be explored with LANDFIRE data:

1. How much of the fire-dependent ecosystems remain on the landscape today?  Using LANDFIRE's [Existing Vegetation Type](https://landfire.gov/evt.php) data combined with the Biophysical Settings data this could be quantified. 
2. For the remaining fire-dependent ecosystems, which succession classes are under/over-represented compared to historical amounts?  Using LANDFIRE's Biophysical Settings [reference condition table](https://landfire.gov/zip/LANDFIRE_CONUS_Reference_Condition_Table_August_2020.zip) combined with the [Succession Class](https://landfire.gov/sclass.php) this question can be answered.
3. Are the patterns we see with Wildland Fire Use accurate?  We would need to work with local managers to verify (or not) this pattern.
